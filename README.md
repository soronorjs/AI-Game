# AI-Game
This is a hobby project I am working on. The reason for this repositry to exist is for others to utilize as an example of how games can be created with AI. It was created with partial help from this course https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/building-an-ai-powered-game/lesson/rk09n/interactive-ai-applications
